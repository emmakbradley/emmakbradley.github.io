Hello dear reader and welcome back! For today's blog post you will be learning how to use the Scrapy Python package to extract valuable data from websites. Our goal today is to build a simple recommendation system that will recommend movies or TV shows based on the number of actors a title shares with your favorite movie or TV show. We will extract this data from the IMDB website. Let's get started!

## Getting Started with Scrapy

Once you have properly installed Scrapy to your device's PIC16B environment, the first step is to created a GitHub repository and initialize your project. Run the following commands in your terminal.


```python
conda activate PIC16B
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
cd IMDB_scraper
```

Next up we will create a new file inside the `spiders` directory and title it `imdb_spider.py`. We will implement our spider in the `ImdbSpider` class of this file. The scraper works by calling various parsing methods in the `ImdbSpider` class to extract data from the web.  Add the following code to your new file. My favorte TV show is "Grey's Anatomy", so the URL that I added below links to the Grey's Anatomy page on IMDB. If you have a different favorite TV show or movie, feel free to change the url down below.


```python
import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/']
```

## Our Parsing Methods
Our parsing methods work by essentially clicking around on the IMDB website as directed and extracting the requested data. Scrapy is able to do so by making use of two of its objects: `request` and `response`. You will see the `request` object often called at the end of each parse function below so that the next corresponding parse function is called and so that the spider can continue to scrape data. The `response` object is called so that the spider can access the data on the web page accordingly.

### parse(self, response)
Our first method starts on a title's home page and navigates to its Cast and Crew page. When we perform this action manually on the IMDB website, we see that the only difference in URL's is that the Cast and Crew page has `fullcredits/` appended to the end of our initial URL. The following function does exactly this and appends `fullcredits/` to the end of our initial URL found in the `response` object. At the end of our function we then yield a `request` object containing `next_page`, our new url we are "clicking" on, and `self.parse_full_credits`, the next parse method we will call.


```python
def parse(self, response):
    '''
    A parsing method that navigates from a title's home page to its Cast and Crew page.
    '''
    # string to append to initial url
    next_page = "fullcredits/"

    # append string and call next parsing method
    if next_page:
        next_page = response.urljoin(next_page)
        yield scrapy.Request(next_page, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

### parse_full_credits(self, response)
Our next parsing method navigates to each actor's IMDB page. We do this using the list comprehension below. The URL for each page is stored in the `a` class with attribute `href` which we are able to access when we loop through `response.css("td.primary_photo a")`. In cases like these you can use web development tools to inspect the elements on your page. 


```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    '''
    A parsing method that navigates to each actor's profile in a title's IMDB
    Cast and Crew page
    '''
    
    # a list of all links to each actor's IMDB page
    next_page_list = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]

    # navigate to each actor's IMDB page
    for next_page in next_page_list:
        next_page = response.urljoin(next_page)
        yield scrapy.Request(next_page, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

### parse_actor_page(self, response)
Our final parsing method retrieves the actor's name and all of their movie or TV show credits. We start by grabbing the actor's name from the web page. Once again it is a useful idea to inspect the elements of the page to determine which HTML tags you will need to call. Next, we will extract every movie or TV show that the actor has performed in. This process is a bit more complex, as it involves looping through the `filmo-row` class and obtaining the text from the `a` attribute. Note that because we are analyzing a TV show, many special TV episodes from Grey's Anatomy are listed as separate titles on IMDB. We don't need to recommend more episodes of Grey's Anatomy to a Grey's Anatomy fan! Therefore we will go ahead and ignore these titles. When we check for these occurrences, we will also add the string "!!!" to the beginning of each title. This will make data cleaning a bit easier later on in this blog post, so sit tight for the time being! Lastly, we will yield a dictionary of actors and the titles of movies and TV shows they have acted in. 


```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    '''
    A parsing method for retrieving all movies and TV shows that an actor
    is listed as performing in on IMDB.
    '''
    
    # get actor name
    actor_name = response.css("span.itemprop::text").get()
    
    # get all movie and TV show titles
    for element in response.css("div.filmo-row"):
        element = response.css("b")
        movie_or_tv_name = element.css("a::text").getall()

        # remove TV specials
        this_title = "Grey's Anatomy"
        movie_or_tv_name = ['!!!' + a for a in movie_or_tv_name if this_title not in a]

    # yield dictionary of data
    yield {
        "actor" : actor_name,
        "movie_or_tv_name": movie_or_tv_name,
    }
```

## Deploying our Spider

We are almost done! Our last step is to run the following command in our terminal. A csv file of the results will then be generated in our `IMDB_scraper` directory. 


```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv
```

## Displaying our Data
Now that we have our data in a csv file, we just need to do a bit of cleaning so that we can visualize our results. We see that our dataframe contains two columns corresponding to the keys and their values in our dictionary we yielded in `parse_actor_page()`.  First, read in the data and remove any rows containing NaN values. 


```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("results.csv")
df = df.dropna()
df
```

As can be seen, each title is separated by the string ",!!!". We can get a list of unique titles by splitting each entry of the `movie_or_tv_name` column by ",!!!" and adding each title to our list of titles. Finally, we will ensure that each title is distinct by converting our list to a set and then back to a list. This removes any duplicate entries and ensures that `unique_list` contains unique elements.


```python
# get all unique movie or tv show names
all_names = df['movie_or_tv_name']
unique_list = []
for names in all_names:
    cut_up_names = names.split(",!!!")
    unique_list += cut_up_names
    
# remove duplicate titles
unique_list = list(set(unique_list))
```

Finally, we will construct a pandas dataframe displaying the most recommended titles based on the number of actors they share with Grey's Anatomy. To do so, we will create a dictionary and check how many Grey's Anatomy actors have appeared in the movies and TV shows from our list of unique titles. Then, we will add the data from this dictionary to a pandas dataframe and sort the values from the `count` column in descending order.


```python
# get count of each title
mydict = {}
for name in unique_list:
    this = df['movie_or_tv_name'].str.contains(name)
    count = sum(this)
    mydict[name] = count

# put data from mydict in a pandas dataframe
mydf = pd.DataFrame(mydict.items(), columns=['movie_or_tv_name', 'count'])

# sort by descending order
mydf = mydf.sort_values(by=['count'], ascending=False)
```

    /var/folders/dq/hnvtynkn1_39_ht_3rnbv2pc0000gp/T/ipykernel_5983/515325572.py:4: UserWarning: This pattern has match groups. To actually get the groups, use str.extract.
      this = df['movie_or_tv_name'].str.contains(name)


# Results!
Let's take a look at the top 20 entries of our dataframe.


```python
mydf[0:20]
```

Nice! Looks like I need to check out the Netflix show "You" sometime. And hopefully you found a new show to watch as well! 

In summary, during this blog post we were able to scrape data from the IMDB website using the Python package Scrapy and use the data to create a simple recommendation system. Hope you enjoyed, and see you next week!
