Hello dear reader and welcome back! This week we will be taking a closer look at some more interesting visualizations using the Plotly package. Additionally, we will be be making use of SQL databases to hold large amounts of data. In the past, our pandas dataframes have sufficed because our datasets have been relatively small. However, in today's blog post we be analyzing and joining multiple large tables, and the best solution for doing so is making a SQL database of our tables. So let's get started!

### Create a Database

First thing's first, let's import our standard packages.


```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
from plotly import express as px
import numpy as np
```

Next, we will initialize a database to store our tables in! To do so, we open a connection to an empty database called "mydatabase.db". We will later add our tables to this database. 


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
```

Our first table will come from the file 'temps.csv'. It contains the average monthly temperature readings for each year at a given atmospheric measurement station. These stations are positioned across the world, so we are able to collect a very large amount of data. The initial file has each year for a given station represented as an individual row with 12 columns corresponding to the average temperature of each month in the year. This is what we call wide data: we have many columns. However, for today's task we will be condensing these 12 month columns into a singular column indicating the month as an integer between 1 and 12. This means that for a given year at a given station, we will have 12 rows with identical values in the "ID" (station ID) and "Year" column that are differentiated by the value in their "Month" and "Temp" columns. Our "Temp" column indicates the average temperature for a given station in a given month in Celsius. Additionally, we will extract the first to characters from our station ID as they indicate the country that the measurements are being taken in.


```python
def prepare_df(df):
    
    # condense month columns into a singular column
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    
    # change "Month" column entries from strings to ints
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    
    # convert from hundredths of a degree Celsius to Celsius
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    
    # extract country_ID
    df["Country_ID"] = df['ID'].str[0:2]
    return(df)
```

Nice! Now that our data frame is a bit easier to work with, let's go ahead and add it to the database that we created earlier. This dataframe is huge: 1,677,096 rows to be exact! We will therefore add it to our database in chunks using an iterator and a chunksize of 100,000. By doing so, we avoid reading in the entire dataframe at once. When we call the to_sql() command, we add the dataframe from the iterator into our database. We must specify "if_exists" as equal to "append" so that we add each chunk of data to the existing table in the database instead of overwriting it. Note that this process takes some time, so sit tight for a moment or two!


```python
# initialize iterator
df_iter = pd.read_csv('temps.csv', chunksize=100000)

# add table to database
for df in df_iter:
    temperatures = prepare_df(df)
    temperatures.to_sql('temperatures', conn, if_exists = 'append', index=False)
```

Alright, let's read in our next two tables. We will call our second table "stations" as it gives us information about the atmospheric measurement stations that are positioned across the world. The "stations" table contains the name of the station, its coordinates in latitude and longitude, and its unique station_id.


```python
# read in stations data
stations = pd.read_csv('station-metadata.csv')

# remove unnecessary column
stations = stations.drop(['STNELEV'], axis = 1)

# add stations table to database
stations.to_sql('stations', conn, if_exists = 'replace', index=False)
```

Our last table that we want to add contains information about country abbreviations and the full country name that they correspond to. We will do a few quick cleaning steps and rename some of our columns to help us out later before adding the table to our database. 


```python
# read in countrues data
countries = pd.read_csv('countries.csv')

# rename columns
countries=countries.rename(columns={"FIPS 10-4": "Country_ID", "Name": "Country"})

# drop unnecessary column
countries = countries.drop(['ISO 3166'], axis = 1)

# add table to database
countries.to_sql('countries', conn, if_exists = 'replace', index=False)
```

Awesome! Our database now contains the three tables that we will need for today's task. It is good practice to close our connection to our database, so let's do that now. 


```python
conn.close()
```

Let's also just take a quick look at the tables that we added to our database so that we know what we are working with!


```python
stations.head()
```

### Write a Query Function

Alright, so the first question that we want to answer today is how much the average yearly change in temperature varies within a given country. We first want to write a function that allows us to extract data according to the country, range of years, and month that we are analyzing. In the function, we can perform a SQL query on our database to extract a dataframe containing the exact information that we want to plot. In doing so, we will merge the three tables in our database to provide us with the information that we are looking for.


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    
    # connect to database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
    
    # sql query
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp, C.Country
    FROM stations S
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON S.ID = T.ID
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.Country_ID=T.Country_ID
    WHERE C.Country == '{country}'
        AND T.Year <= '{year_end}'
        AND T.Year >= '{year_begin}'
        AND T.month == {month}
    """
    
    # convert to pandas data frame
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    
    conn.close()
    return df
```

Let's test our function out: sure enough it looks good! We can see that we only extracted temperature, latitude, and longitude measurements during the month of January between 1980 and 2020 from stations in India.


```python
df = query_climate_database(country="India",
                       year_begin=1980,
                       year_end=2020,
                       month=1)
```


```python
df
```

You might recall that we are actually trying to plot the average yearly change in temperature, so we need to add an additional column with this information. For this, we'll use our old friend, linear regression. We'll use the statistical fact that, when regressing Temp against Year, the coefficient of Year will be an estimate of the yearly change in Temp.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# a function that computes the average yearly change in temperature
def coef(data_group):
    x = data_group[['Year']]
    y = data_group['Temp']
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x,y)
    return LR.coef_[0]
```

Additionally, we want to make sure we are only looking at stations with enough data to give us a reliable result! We will allow the user to decide on the minimum number of obseravtions, but for now heare is a function that filters data accordingly.


```python
def filter_data(df,min_obs):
    df.groupby(['NAME']).count()
    return df[df['LATITUDE']>min_obs]
```

Alright! Now it's time to combine all of our hard work into a function that plots the answer to our initial question: how does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country? Note that this function plots using Plotly, so we will allow the user to make their own specifications by including the **kwargs variable.


```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    # get df
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    
    # filter data
    df = filter_data(df, min_obs)
    
    # get linear coefs
    coefs = df.groupby(['NAME', 'Month']).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.round(4)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    coefs = coefs.rename(columns = {0 : "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"})

    # add linear coefs to df
    df = pd.merge(df, coefs, on = ["NAME"])
    
    # plot fig
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df, 
                        lat = "LATITUDE",
                        lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                        hover_name = "NAME", 
                        color = "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)",
                        color_continuous_midpoint=0,
                        **kwargs)
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":25,"l":0,"b":5})
    
    return fig
```


```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdBu_r
fig1 = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 3,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map,
                                   title="Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in January for stations in India, years 1980-2020")

fig1.show()
```
{% include my_plot1.html %}


From this plot it looks like southern India's average January temperature increased in the south but decreased in the northeast. Clearly there is some significant temperature fluctuation happening in India.

### Change in Average Yearly Temperature Over Time

Okay, so global warming is a bit scary. Next we might be wondering how the average yearly temperature in a country might be changing over time. An interesting figure might plot how temperature has changed since the early 20th centrury. Let's go ahead write a new query function that will allow us to specify the country we want to observe as well as the range of years. This will look pretty similar to our function from above. We will access our database, extract only the necessary information, convert our data into a pandas dataframe, and close the connection to our database!


```python
def query_climate_database2(country, year_begin, year_end):
    
    # connect to database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
    
    # sql query
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.NAME, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp, C.Country
    FROM stations S
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON S.ID = T.ID
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.Country_ID=T.Country_ID
    WHERE C.Country == '{country}'
        AND T.Year <= '{year_end}'
        AND T.Year >= '{year_begin}'
    """
    
    # convert to pandas data frame
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    
    conn.close()
    return df
```

Let's also go ahead and define a helper function for when we plot our difference in temperature. This function will extract the first temperature value and then compute the difference between its value and all other temperatures in the dataframe.


```python
def diff(df):
    initial = df.iloc[0]
    return df - initial
```

Finally, let's finish up by wrapping the code for our plot up into a function. Similar to earlier, we will begin by calling our query function and obtaining a dataframe for us to work with. Next we will want to compute the average yearly temperature in our country. Recall that the dataframe contains the average temperature per month per year, so we will need to group by year before computing the average temperature. After this, we can go ahead and make use of the difference function that we defined above to create a new column containing the difference in temperature since the first year recorded. Lastly, we will code up our bar graph and add a few tweaks to help with its readability. We will add the yearly average temperature as a value in the hover_data, and we will also fix the labels so that the reader can easily understand the data. 


```python
def plot2(country, year_begin, year_end, **kwargs):
    # get data
    df = query_climate_database2(country, year_begin, year_end)
    
    # compute avg yearly temp
    df=df.groupby(['Year'])['Temp'].aggregate(np.mean)
    df=df.reset_index()
    df['Temp'] = df['Temp'].round(2)
    
    # compute differences
    df['diff']=df['Temp'].transform(diff)
    df['diff'] = df['diff'].round(2)
    
    # plot figure
    fig = px.bar(df, 
            x='Year', 
            y='diff',
            hover_data=['Temp'],
            labels={'Temp':'Average Yearly Temperature', 'diff':'Difference in Temperature (°C)'},
            color='diff',
            template="simple_white",
            **kwargs)
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":30,"l":0,"b":0})
    return fig
```


```python
# specify colors of our plot
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdBu_r

fig2 = plot2('India', 1901, 2020, 
      color_continuous_scale=color_map,
      title='Difference in Average Yearly Temperature in India Since 1901',
      color_continuous_midpoint=0)

fig2.show()
```
{% include my_plot2.html %}

Yikes! That's a whole lot of red. From this plot we can clearly tell that the average yearly temperature in India has increased drastically since 1901.

### Max and Min Recorded Temperatures?
Okay, so clearly global warming is affecting the average yearly temperature for countries. Based on the previous graph, we might predict that the maximum recorded temperature for a station in a given country has most likely occurred within the past 2 decades. Let's go ahead and make one more plot illustrating this. In this case, we will work towards building a histogram that indicates the range of years the most maximum temperatures per station has occurred in. 

We will start off with one last SQL query function. We will limit our data to a singular country and month. In addition, we will also specify the range of years we wish to examine. 


```python
def query_climate_database3(country, month, year_begin, year_end):
    
    # connect to database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
    
    # sql query
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.NAME, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp, C.Country
    FROM stations S
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON S.ID = T.ID
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.Country_ID=T.Country_ID
    WHERE C.Country == '{country}'
        AND T.Year <= '{year_end}'
        AND T.Year >= '{year_begin}'
        AND T.month == {month}
    """
    
    # convert to pandas data frame
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    
    conn.close()
    return df
```

Now that that's done, let's write another quick helper function that will help us with the histogram we are building towards. The following function will help compute the coldest year per each station by sorting the temperatures from coldest to warmest.


```python
def my_rank(x):
    return x.argsort().argsort()
```

Finally we can go ahead and write our function for our plot. Similar to before, we will start with our SQL query function and obtain the dataframe we will be working with. Next, we will determine the rank of each yearly temperature per station. Using the rank, we will then determine the coldest and warmest year recorded per each station. Lastly, we will clean up our data and write our histogram function!


```python
def plot3(country, month, year_begin, year_end, **kwargs):
    # get dataframe
    df = query_climate_database3(country, month, year_begin, year_end)
    
    # determine rank of each year per station
    df["rank"] = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Temp"].transform(my_rank)
    
    # find the coldest year per station
    coldest = df[df["rank"] == 0]
    coldest['rank'] = 'min temp'
    
    # find the warmest year per station
    df["max_rank"] = df.groupby(["NAME"])["rank"].transform(np.max)
    warmest = df[df["rank"] == df["max_rank"]]
    warmest['rank'] = 'max temp'
    warmest = warmest.drop(['max_rank'], axis=1)

    # combine warmest and coldest dataframes
    result = pd.concat([warmest,coldest])
    
    # plot figure
    fig = px.histogram(result, 
                 x = "Year", 
                 facet_row='rank',
                 template="simple_white",
                 color='rank',
                 opacity = 0.5,
                 color_discrete_sequence = ['red','blue'],
                 **kwargs)
    return fig
```


```python
fig3 = plot3('Italy', 1, 1901, 2019, 
     title='Year of Extreme January Temperatures in Italy')

fig3.show()
```

{% include my_best_plot3.html %}
   
Clearly, most of the maximum temperatures recorded at each station in Italy have occurred within the past 15-20 years. It is especially concerning that very few maximum temperatures occurred before 1950. There is a less significant pattern for the minimum recorded temperatures, but the data is still useful to have.

# Conclusion
Hopefully you learned a few things today about making visualizations with plotly and about how scary global warming really is. I'll see you again next week!
