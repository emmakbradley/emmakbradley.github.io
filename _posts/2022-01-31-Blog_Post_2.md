title: Creating a Web Application Using Flask
---

Hello again and welcome back dear reader! In today's tutorial we will be going over how to create your own super fancy web application using Flask, a python web framework. Let's get started!

First things first, create a python file and title it `app.py`. This file will contain all of the necessary functions for our webapp to run. Start with the following commands to intialize our Flask app.


```python
import sqlite3

from flask import Flask, render_template, request, g
app = Flask(__name__)
```

The web app that we are programming will be a simple message bank that allows users to input a message along with their name or handle. The webapp should therefore be able to handle these submissions, store them in a database, and then display them. We can program and display the results of these tasks using html templates called within the function `render_template()` in our `app.py` file. For today's purposes we will use 3 templates titled `base.html`, `submit.html`, and `view.html` to gather submissions and display them.

## What is a Template?
At this point you might be wondering what exactly a template is. Well, according to the Flask documentation:


**"Templates are files that contain static data as well as placeholders for dynamic data. A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document".**

Basically, templates are HTML files that contain HTML code that allows the user to interact with the web app. Templates determine what the user sees on your webpage and what information they are able to collect and provide. Our webapp is a dynamic webpage because it collects data from users and then stores it in a SQL database. Hopefully you paid attention to blog post 1, because we will be using our SQL skills again this week!

### base.html

The `base.html` contains the code that is displayed when the user first opens the webapp. The other two templates `submit.html` and `view.html` then extend the `base.html` file according to the user's request. In the `base.html` file we also link our CSS stylesheet that will be used to determine the details of what our webapp looks like. Some examples of attributes in the CSS style sheet include font, font size, and background color. Because the other template files extend the base template, they will also make use of the CSS style sheet. In our base file we include the title of our webapp, the links to submit and view messages, as well as a placeholder for a content class. Depending on the user's request, the content placeholder will be filled in with information from `submit.html` or `view.html`. Let's next take a closer look at the `submit.html` file.

### submit.html

The first thing you should notice is that the first line of code ensures that the `submit.html` file extends the `base.html` file. We then add a header to our content by using jinja tags to specify that a header is being created. The line labeled as 'block title' is of the class h1 and incorporates a title. The line specifying block content indicates that we are now extending the content from the `base.html` file. Because we are retrieving user data, our HTML class is `form` and we specify that our method is `POST` so that we are later able to add the data to our database. The following lines create two text boxes with labels and a submit button. The first text box makes use of its label attribute to prompt the user to enter a confession. This confession is inputted as text and stored under the name `message`. Keep this name in mind as it will be used later. The same is done for a second text box in which the user is prompted for their name. The text that is inputted is also stored but this time under the name `handle`. Lastly, a submit button is included.

The jinja tags "if thanks" and "if error" are only accessed when they are included as arguments in the `render_template()` function. We will talk more about this function in a bit, but what you should know for now is that they indicate whether the user's message submission was successful or not.

For reference, here is a screenshot of what the submit page looks like on our webapp! As can be seen in the purple box, we have a title, two input boxes with labels, and a button for the user to submit with.

### view.html
Our final template indicates what the `view messages` link displays. Its structure is fairly similar to that of the `submit.html` template as it also extents the `base.html` template and specifies the content that is displayed. When writing the code for the template, I used a for loop to loop through the different messages queried by our database. Once again, we will talk more about this in depth in a little bit, but the messages are passed as an argument into the `render_template()` function when `view.html` is called. Lastly, I included this fun GIF for your enjoyment :)

## Functions

Let's go back to our `app.py` file. Like we talked about earlier, this file contains the code that dictates how our webapp runs. We therefore need to write a few functions to make sure that we are able to collect, store, and display the user's messages (or confessions).

### get_message_db()

Our first function initializes a SQL database if one has not already been created. We can check this by looking for the database in the `g` attribute of the app. After this, we then add a table titled `messages` to our `message_db` if it doesn't already exist. Luckily, SQL provides us with a very convenient command that allows us to do so in one line using the SQL command `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. In the same SQL command we also specify that we would like our messages table to contain 3 columns titled `id`, `handle`, and `message`. Finally, we return a connection to our database.

```python
def get_message_db():
    if 'message_db' not in g:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")
    g.message_db.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages(id INTEGER, handle TEXT, message TEXT)''')
    return g.message_db
```

### insert_message_db()

Our next function does the actual work of retrieving the data and storing it in our database. Therefore the first line of the function connects to the `message_db` from our `get_message_db` function. We also initialize a cursor to allow us to extract and add information to our database. Since we are obtaining messages and handles from our users, it is probably a good idea to give each message and handle a unique ID to allow us to differentiate between different entries. We can do so by extracting the current number of rows in the database and adding 1 to this value.

The next few lines make use of the request attribute of our Flask app to extract the message and handle from our `submit.html` file. We are able to do so because we named the user's entries accordingly in our `submit.html` file so that we could later access the data in this function. 

The last few lines of code should look very familiar! We once again make use of a SQL command to access our database, however during this blog post we are inserting new rows into our messages table instead of extracting existing data as we did in blog post 1. We therefore must include the line `g.message_db.commit()` to ensure that our database is updated accordingly. Lastly, remember to close the connection.


```python
def insert_message(request):
    # connect to db
    g.message_db = get_message_db()

    # intialize cursor
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
    
    # count rows and assign unique id
    cursor.execute("select count(*) from messages")
    rows = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    this_id = 1 + rows
    
    # get message data
    message = request.form["message"]
    handle = request.form["handle"]
    
    # sql cmd
    cmd = f"""INSERT INTO messages (id, handle, message)
    VALUES('{this_id}', '{message}', '{handle}')"""
    
    # add message to db
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    g.message_db.commit()
    
    # close connection
    g.message_db.close()
    return
```

### random_messages()

In our `view.html` template, we are going to want to display some but not all of the messages from our database. We will therefore write a function that selects `n` random messages to display to the user. As we did in our previous functions, our first few steps are to connect to our database and initialize a cursor. We then write and execute a SQL command that selects a random `n` rows from our `messages` table in our database. We can then retrieve these messages in the form of a list of 3-tuples using the line `cursor.fetchall()`. The first element in each tuple will contain the message id, the second the user's handle, and the third the user's message. Lastly, we close our connection and return our list of 3-tuples.


```python
def random_messages(n):
    # connect to db
    g.message_db = get_message_db()

    # initialize cursor
    cursor = g.message_db.cursor()

    # grab n random messages
    cmd = f"""SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT '{n}'"""
    cursor.execute(cmd)

    messages_list = cursor.fetchall()

    # close database
    g.message_db.close()

    return messages_list
```

### main():

When the webpp is first launched by the user, it follows the command `@app.route("/")` and the main() function is called. After this, the function render_template (recall that we imported this function at the beginning from Flask!) is returned so that the `base.html` template is rendered. 


```python
@app.route("/")
def main():
    return render_template('base.html')
```

### submit()
When the user clicks on the `submit a confession` url at the top of the webapp, the `submit()` function is called. This is because in our `base.html` file we tagged the corresponding url as `submit`. See! I told you it would all make sense eventually! When the user first clicks on the `submit a question` url, the `GET` method is called and the user is prompted to enter their data and the `submit.html` template is rendered. Once the user inputs their message and name, the `submit()` function is called again, however this time the `POST` method is called because the user provided data. In terms of the code shown below, we now can take a look at the `else` statement and we see that the `insert_message()` function from earlier is called! Recall that the insert_function takes the user's message and handle and inserts it into the `messages_db` database with a corresponding unique ID. Since we already wrote a function for this above, all we have to do now is call it with the `request` argument! As long as this works properly, we then render our `submit.html` template one last time, however this time we include the argument `thanks=True`. If we take one last look back at our `submit.html` template, we see that the contents of the "if thanks" jinja tag are now rendered, and a short message is displayed thanking the user for their input. In the event that the webapp is unable to do so, the `submit.html` template is rendered however an error message is displayed to the user.


```python
@app.route('/submit/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('submit.html')
    else:
        insert_message(request)
        try:
            return render_template('submit.html', thanks=True)
        except:
            return render_template('submit.hmtl', error=True)
```

### view()
Similar to the `submit()` function, `view()` is called when the user clicks on the `view messages` url at the top of the webapp. The function first calls our friend the function `random_messages()` that we wrote earlier and retrieves a list of `n` rows from our database and assigns it to the variable `messages_list`. We then pass this list into into our `render_template()` function with the `view.html` file. In the `view.html` file, we are able to loop over the entries in `messages_list` and display their contents on our webapp.


```python
@app.route('/view/')
def view():
    messages_list = random_messages(3)
    return render_template('view.html', m = messages_list)
```

# Conclusion

Wow! We have now successfully written our first ever webapp using Flask! Give yourself a pat on the back because it wasn't easy. To sum up what we did:
- We first discussed templates and wrote 3 for our app: `base.html`, `submit.html`, and `view.html`. These templates determined what our webapp looked like when we clicked their corresponding links.
- Next we wrote a few helpful functions to help us create a database (`get_message_db()`), add messages to our database (`insert_message()`), and retrieve random messages from our database (`random_messages()`).
- We then wrote the functions `main()`, `submit()`, and `view()` that are called when their corresponding app route is called. These functions linked the `app.py` file to our templates that we wrote at the beginning using the function `render_template()`.

Hopefully now you are able to write your own simple webapp using Flask. Thanks for reading, and I'll see you next week!
