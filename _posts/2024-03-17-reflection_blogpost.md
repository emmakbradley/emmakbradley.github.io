### Project Goals
The goal of our project was to perform sentiment analysis on trending TikToks and observe any major themes present. Since I did the webapp for the project, I am especially proud of myself for taking on this portion of the project by myself and for seeking out help when I needed it during office hours. In addition, I am proud of the way the webapp looks! I figured out how to adapt source code from a github repository to the rough draft of the Flask app I had already written. I think the webapp looks very sleek and professional, and it has come a long way since its rough draft! 

### Further Improvements
To further improve our project, it would be cool to have the option to display more plots on the webapp. In addition, it would be useful to allow the user to actively query current trending tiktoks and their sentiments. Currently our sentiment analysis is based on data collected over a 13 day period, so the user is limited to the data collected during that window of time. 

### Our Proposal
As mentioned, we initially wanted to allow the user to actively query current trending tiktoks and their sentiments. This turned out to be fairly difficult, so we revised our plan and based our sentiment analysis on data collected over a 13 day period. 

### What I Learned
This project taught me the basics of web development using Flask. In addition, it challenged me to improve my debugging skills, as I am still very new to Flask so I encountered many errors along the way. I learned to use my resources such as office hours or Stack Overflow to help solve my errors! Lastly, this project taught me how to use GitHub to collaborate on projects with group members. In PIC 16A my group using Google Colaboratory , so I am looking forward to future collaborations with others using my newfound GitHub skills.

### My Future
In the future I hope to work as a data analyst or data scientist with a company. In this role I am positive that I will be asked frequently to collaborate with others. After PIC 16A I felt nervous about taking on large tasks as a group, however our group got along very well and I thought we were pretty successful! In addition, I strengthened my ability to problem solve and trouble shoot issues when they arose. Lastly, I strengthened my ability to teach myself using resources from the internet. We had to use multiple packages and modules such as VADER, WordSegment, and SpeechRecognition to accomplish our sentiment analysis task. I have been told that the data science world changes often and as a result if you are working in the field then you are constantly learning new techniques and methods. As a result, this project has been excellent preparation for my future career.
