I am a fourth year student at UCLA majoring in Applied Mathematics with a Specialization in Computing. Through my undergraduate studies I have developed strong computational skills, excelled in proof based analysis courses, and gained extensive programming experience in Python and other languages. In addition, I have experience as a Learning Assistant for a Python programming course at UCLA, I work as a Lead Resident Assistant with UCLA Residential Life, and I have extensive leadership skills from my role as a New Student Advisor. My passions include math, crossword puzzles, and mental health. 

I am interested in pursuing a career in data science following my graduation in Spring 2023. This website is a summary of the data science skills I have aquired from my coursework at UCLA. Feel free to take a look around!
