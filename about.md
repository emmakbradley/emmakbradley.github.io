Hi there! I am a soon-to-be graduate from UCLA majoring in Applied Mathematics with a Specialization in Computing. Through my undergraduate studies I have developed strong problem solving skills, excelled in proof based analysis courses, and gained extensive programming experience in Python and other languages. In addition, I have experience as a Volunteer Research Data Analyst with UCLA Residential Life, I have worked as a Learning Assistant for calculus and Python programming courses at UCLA, and I have extensive leadership skills from my role as a New Student Advisor. I am passionate about math, crossword puzzles, and mental health! 

I am interested in pursuing a career in data science or data analytics following my graduation in June 2023. This website is a summary of the data science skills I have aquired from my coursework at UCLA. Feel free to take a look around!
